Authorization
-------------

KubeVirt authorization is performed using Kubernete’s Resource Based
Authorization Control system (RBAC). RBAC allows cluster admins to grant
access to cluster resources by binding RBAC roles to users.

For example, an admin creates an RBAC role that represents the
permissions required to create a VirtualMachineInstance. The admin can
then bind that role to users in order to grant them the permissions
required to launch a VirtualMachineInstance.

With RBAC roles, admins can grant users targeted access to various
KubeVirt features.

KubeVirt Default RBAC ClusterRoles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

KubeVirt comes with a set of predefined RBAC ClusterRoles that can be
used to grant users permissions to access KubeVirt Resources.

Default View Role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *kubevirt.io:view* ClusterRole gives users permissions to view all
KubeVirt resources in the cluster. The permissions to create, delete,
modify or access any KubeVirt resources beyond viewing the resource’s
spec are not included in this role. This means a user with this role
could see that a VirtualMachineInstance is running, but neither shutdown
nor gain access to that VirtualMachineInstance via console/VNC.

Default Edit Role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *kubevirt.io:edit* ClusterRole gives users permissions to modify all
KubeVirt resources in the cluster. For example, a user with this role
can create new VirtualMachineInstances, delete VirtualMachineInstances,
and gain access to both console and VNC.

Default Admin Role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *kubevirt.io:admin* ClusterRole grants users full permissions to all
KubeVirt resources, including the ability to delete collections of
resources.

The admin role also grants users access to view and modify the KubeVirt
runtime config. This config exists within a configmap called
*kubevirt-config* in the namespace the KubeVirt components are running.

_NOTE_ Users are only guaranteed the ability to modify the kubevirt
runtime configuration if a ClusterRoleBinding is used. A RoleBinding
will work to provide kubevirt-config access only if the RoleBinding
targets the same namespace the kubevirt-config exists in.

Binding Default ClusterRoles to Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The KubeVirt default ClusterRoles are granted to users by creating
either a ClusterRoleBinding or RoleBinding object.

Binding within All Namespaces
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With a ClusterRoleBinding, users receive the permissions granted by the
role across all namespaces.

Binding within Single Namespace
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With a RoleBinding, users receive the permissions granted by the role
only within a targeted namespace.

Extending Kubernetes Default Roles with KubeVirt permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aggregated ClusterRole Kubernetes feature facilitates combining
multiple ClusterRoles into a single aggregated ClusterRole. This feature
is commonly used to extend the default Kubernetes roles with permissions
to access custom resources that do not exist in the Kubernetes core.

In order to extend the default Kubernetes roles to provide permission to
access KubeVirt resources, we need to add the following labels to the
KubeVirt ClusterRoles.

....
kubectl label clusterrole kubevirt.io:admin rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin=true
kubectl label clusterrole kubevirt.io:edit rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit=true
kubectl label clusterrole kubevirt.io:view rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view=true
....

By adding these labels, any user with a RoleBinding or
ClusterRoleBinding involving one of the default Kubernetes roles will
automatically gain access to the equivalent KubeVirt roles as well.

More information about aggregated cluster roles can be found
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles[here]

Creating Custom RBAC Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the default KubeVirt ClusterRoles are not expressive enough, admins
can create their own custom RBAC roles to grant user access to KubeVirt
resources. The creation of a RBAC role is inclusive only, meaning
there’s no way to deny access. Instead access is only granted.

Below is an example of what KubeVirt’s default admin ClusterRole looks
like. A custom RBAC role can be created by reducing the permissions in
this example role.

....
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: my-custom-rbac-role
  labels:
    kubevirt.io: ""
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - subresources.kubevirt.io
    resources:
      - virtualmachineinstances/console
      - virtualmachineinstances/vnc
    verbs:
      - get
  - apiGroups:
      - kubevirt.io
    resources:
      - virtualmachineinstances
      - virtualmachines
      - virtualmachineinstancepresets
      - virtualmachineinstancereplicasets
    verbs:
      - get
      - delete
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - list
      - watch
      - deletecollection
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - configmaps
    resourceNames:
      - kubevirt-config
    verbs:
      - update
      - get
      - patch
....
