DevicePlugins
------------------------------------

Some devices on each host are made available to VMI's created via KubeVirt.
Currently this list includes tun, kvm and vhost-net devices. KubeVirt uses the
DevicePlugin mechanism from Kuberentes to make this possible. The benefit of
this approach is that no special privileges to create device nodes need to be
inherited by the virt-launcher pod.

The default number of devices provided this way is 110, which is also the
default number of pods that can be assigned to each Kubernetes node.

How To Change the Number of Available Devices
------------------------------------

To change the number of devices that will be exposed by the DevicePlugin
framework, edit the virt-handler DaemonSet:

`kubectl -n kubevirt edit ds virt-handler`

The current manifest used to define the virt-handler DaemonSet will be exposed
in an editor. Add the `--max-devices` flag to the `--command` stanza:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  generation: 1
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubevirt-operator
    kubevirt.io: virt-handler
  name: virt-handler
  namespace: kubevirt
spec:
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      kubevirt.io: virt-handler
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""
        scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations: '[{"key":"CriticalAddonsOnly","operator":"Exists"}]'
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        kubevirt.io: virt-handler
        prometheus.kubevirt.io: ""
      name: virt-handler
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - virt-handler
        - --port
        - "8443"
        - --hostname-override
        - $(NODE_NAME)
        - --pod-ip-address
        - $(MY_POD_IP)
        - -v
        - "2"
        - --max-devices
        - "300"
        env:
        - name: NODE_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
...
```

The full manifest has been truncated for clarity. In this example, the
`--max-devices` flag was added and set to 300.

WARNING: command line arguments must be strings. Use `"300"`, not `300`.

Once each virt-handler pod is re-deployed and running, the new number of devices
should be in effect. To verify the change took effect, inspect the nodes of the
cluster:

`kubectl get node -o yaml`

The allocatable and capacity sections of each node should reflect the newly
configured `--max-devices` flag.

```
    allocatable:
      cpu: "5"
      devices.kubevirt.io/kvm: "300"
      devices.kubevirt.io/tun: "300"
      devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net: "300"
      ephemeral-storage: "36190907537"
      hugepages-1Gi: "0"
      hugepages-2Mi: 128Mi
      memory: 4679260Ki
      pods: "110"
    capacity:
      cpu: "5"
      devices.kubevirt.io/kvm: "300"
      devices.kubevirt.io/tun: "300"
      devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net: "300"
      ephemeral-storage: 39269648Ki
      hugepages-1Gi: "0"
      hugepages-2Mi: 128Mi
      memory: 4912732Ki
      pods: "110"
```
