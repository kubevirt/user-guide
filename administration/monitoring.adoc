Monitoring KubeVirt components
------------------------------

All KubeVirt system-components expose Prometheus metrics at their
`/metrics` REST endpoint.

Custom Service Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prometheus supports service discovery based on
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#pod[Pods]
and
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#endpoints[Endpoints]
out of the box. Both can be used to discover KubeVirt services.

All Pods which expose metrics are labeled with `prometheus.kubevirt.io`
and contain a port-definition which is called `metrics`. In the KubeVirt
release-manifests, the default `metrics` port is `8443`.

The above labels and port informations are collected by a `Service`
called `kubevirt-prometheus-metrics`. Kuberentes automatically creates a
corresponding `Endpoint` with an equal name:

....
$ kubectl get endpoints -n kubevirt kubevirt-prometheus-metrics -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  labels:
    kubevirt.io: ""
    prometheus.kubevirt.io: ""
  name: kubevirt-prometheus-metrics
  namespace: kubevirt
subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: 10.244.0.5
    nodeName: node01
    targetRef:
      kind: Pod
      name: virt-handler-cjzg6
      namespace: kubevirt
      resourceVersion: "4891"
      uid: c67331f9-bfcf-11e8-bc54-525500d15501
  - ip: 10.244.0.6
  [...]
  ports:
  - name: metrics
    port: 8443
    protocol: TCP
....

By watching this endpoint for added and removed IPs to
`subsets.addresses` and appending the `metrics` port from
`subsets.ports`, it is possible to always get a complete list of
ready-to-be-scraped Prometheus targets.

Integrating with the prometheus-operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator[prometheus-operator]
can make use of the `kubevirt-prometheus-metrics` service to
automatically create the appropriate Prometheus config.

First deploy the prometheus-operator, then create a prometheus instance:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      prometheus.kubevirt.io: ""
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 400Mi
----

Then create a `ServiceMonitor` which references the
`kubevirt-prometheus-metrics` via the `prometheus.kubevirt.io` label:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: kubevirt
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: ""
    prometheus.kubevirt.io: ""
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      prometheus.kubevirt.io: ""
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    scheme: https
    tlsConfig:
      insecureSkipVerify: true
----

Starting from kubevirt 0.17, the served TLS certificates are signed by the k8s
cluster authority. It is therefore possible to verify the TLS certificate of
scrape targets by using `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt`
as certificate authority:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: kubevirt
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: ""
    prometheus.kubevirt.io: ""
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      prometheus.kubevirt.io: ""
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    scheme: https
    tlsConfig:
      caFile: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
----

Integrating with the OpenShift cluster-monitoring-operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the
https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator[cluster-monitoring-operator]
is up and running, deploy the `ServiceMonitor` definition from above.
Because the definition contains the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring`
label, it will automatically be picked up by the cluster monitor.

Metrics about Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The endpoints report metrics related to the runtime behaviour of the Virtual Machines.
All the relevant metrics are prefixed with `kubevirt_vm`.

Important Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Detecting connection issues for the REST client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following query to get a counter for all REST call which
indicate connection issues:

....
rest_client_requests_total{code="<error>"}
....

If this counter is continuously increasing, it is an indicator that the
corresponding KubeVirt component has general issues to connect to the
apiserver
