VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet
--------------------------------

VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A _VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet_ tries to ensures that a specified
number of VirtualMachineInstance replicas are running at any time. In
other words, a _VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet_ makes sure that a
VirtualMachineInstance or a homogeneous set of VirtualMachineInstances
is always up and ready. It is very similar to a
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/[Kubernetes
ReplicaSet].

No state is kept and no guarantees about the maximum number of
VirtualMachineInstance replicas which are up are given. For example, the
_VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet_ may decide to create new replicas if
possibly still running VMs are entering an unknown state.

How to use a VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet_ allows us to specify a
_VirtualMachineInstanceTemplate_ in `spec.template`. It consists of
`ObjectMetadata` in `spec.template.metadata`, and a
`VirtualMachineInstanceSpec` in `spec.template.spec`. The specification
of the virtual machine is equal to the specification of the virtual
machine in the `VirtualMachineInstance` workload.

`spec.replicas` can be used to specify how many replicas are wanted. If
unspecified, the default value is 1. This value can be updated anytime.
The controller will react to the changes.

`spec.selector` is used by the controller to keep track of managed
virtual machines. The selector specified there must be able to match the
virtual machine labels as specified in `spec.template.metadata.labels`.
If the selector does not match these labels, or they are empty, the
controller will simply do nothing except from logging an error. The user
is responsible for not creating other virtual machines or
_VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSets_ which conflict with the selector and
the template labels.

Exposing a VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet as a Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet could be exposed as a service. When
this is done, one of the VirtualMachineInstances replicas will be picked
for the actual delivery of the service.

For example, exposing SSH port (22) as a ClusterIP service using virtctl
on a VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet:

[source,bash]
----
$ virtctl expose vmirs vmi-ephemeral --name vmiservice --port 27017 --target-port 22
----

All service exposure options that apply to a VirtualMachineInstance
apply to a VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet. See
http://kubevirt.io/user-guide/#/workloads/virtual-machines/expose-service[Exposing
VirtualMachineInstance] for more details.

When to use a VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: The base assumption is that referenced disks are read-only or
that the VMIs are writing internally to a tmpfs. The most obvious volume
sources for VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSets which KubeVirt supports
are referenced below. If other types are used *data corruption* is
possible.

Using VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet is the right choice when one
wants many identical VMs and does not care about maintaining any disk
state after the VMs are terminated.

link:workloads/virtual-machines/disks-and-volumes.md[Volume types] which
work well in combination with a VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet are:

* *cloudInitNoCloud*
* *ephemeral*
* *containerDisk*
* *emptyDisk*
* *configMap*
* *secret*
* any other type, if the VMI writes internally to a tmpfs

Fast starting ephemeral Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This use-case involves small and fast booting VMs with little
provisioning performed during initialization.

In this scenario, migrations are not important. Redistributing VM
workloads between Nodes can be achieved simply by deleting managed
VirtualMachineInstances which are running on an overloaded Node. The
`eviction` of such a VirtualMachineInstance can happen by directly
deleting the VirtualMachineInstance instance (KubeVirt aware workload
redistribution) or by deleting the corresponding Pod where the Virtual
Machine runs in (Only Kubernetes aware workload redistribution).

Slow starting ephemeral Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this use-case one has big and slow booting VMs, and complex or
resource intensive provisioning is done during boot. More specifically,
the timespan between the creation of a new VM and it entering the ready
state is long.

In this scenario, one still does not care about the state, but since
re-provisioning VMs is expensive, migrations are important. Workload
redistribution between Nodes can be achieved by migrating
VirtualMachineInstances to different Nodes. A workload redistributor
needs to be aware of KubeVirt and create migrations, instead of
`evicting` VirtualMachineInstances by deletion.

NOTE: The simplest form of having a migratable ephemeral
VirtualMachineInstance, will be to use local storage based on
`ContainerDisks` in combination with a file based backing store.
However, migratable backing store support has not officially landed yet
in KubeVirt and is untested.

Example

[source,yaml]

Saving this manifest into `testreplicaset.yaml` and submitting it to
Kubernetes will create three virtual machines based on the template.

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create -f testreplicaset.yaml

`Replicas` is `3` and `Ready Replicas` is `2`. This means that at the
moment when showing the status, three Virtual Machines were already
created, but only two are running and ready.

Scaling via the Scale Subresource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This requires the `CustomResourceSubresources` feature gate to be
enables for clusters prior to 1.11.

The `VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet` supports the `scale` subresource. As a
consequence it is possible to scale it via `kubectl`:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl scale vmirs myvmirs --replicas 5
----

Using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This requires at cluster newer or equal to 1.11.

The https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[HorizontalPodAutoscaler] (HPA) can be used with a
`VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet`. Simply reference it in the spec of the
autoscaler:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myhpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet
    name: vmi-replicaset-cirros
    apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
----

Right now `kubectl autoscale` does not work with Custom Resources. Only the
declarative form of writing the HPA yaml manually and posting it via `kubectl
create` is supported.
