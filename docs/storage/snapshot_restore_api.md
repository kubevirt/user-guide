# Snapshot Restore API

The `snapshot.kubevirt.io` API Group defines resources for snapshotting and restoring KubeVirt `VirtualMachines`

## Prerequisites

### VolumeSnapshotClass

KubeVirt leverages the `VolumeSnapshot` functionality of Kubernetes [CSI drivers](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html) for capturing persistent `VirtualMachine` state.  So, you should make sure that your `VirtualMachine` uses `DataVolumes` or `PersistentVolumeClaims` backed by a `StorageClass` that supports `VolumeSnapshots` and a `VolumeSnapshotClass` is properly configured for that `StorageClass`.

KubeVirt looks for Kubernetes Volume Snapshot related APIs/resources in the `v1` version. To make sure that KubeVirt's snapshot controller is able to snapshot the VirtualMachine and referenced volumes as expected, Kubernetes Volume Snapshot APIs must be served from `v1` version.

To list `VolumeSnapshotClasses`:

```bash
kubectl get volumesnapshotclass
```

Make sure the `provisioner` property of your `StorageClass` matches the `driver` property of the `VolumeSnapshotClass`

Even if you have no `VolumeSnapshotClasses` in your cluster, `VirtualMachineSnapshots` are not totally useless.  They will still backup your `VirtualMachine` configuration.

### Snapshot Feature Gate

Snapshot/Restore support must be enabled in the feature gates to be supported. The
[feature gates](../cluster_admin/activating_feature_gates.md#how-to-activate-a-feature-gate)
field in the KubeVirt CR must be expanded by adding the `Snapshot` to it.


## Snapshot a VirtualMachine

Snapshotting a virtualMachine is supported for online and offline vms.

When snapshotting a running vm the controller will check for qemu guest agent in the vm. If the agent exists it will freeze the vm filesystems before taking the snapshot and unfreeze after the snapshot. It is recommended to take online snapshots with the guest agent for a better snapshot, if not present a best effort snapshot will be taken.

> *Note* To check if your vm has a qemu-guest-agent check for 'AgentConnected' in the vm status.

There will be an indication in the vmSnapshot status if the snapshot was taken online and with or without guest agent participation.

> *Note* Online snapshot with hotplugged disks is supported, only persistent hotplugged disks will be included in the snapshot.


To snapshot a `VirtualMachine` named `larry`, apply the following yaml.

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualMachineSnapshot
metadata:
  name: snap-larry
spec:
  source:
    apiGroup: kubevirt.io
    kind: VirtualMachine
    name: larry
```

You can check the vmSnapshot phase in the vmSnapshot status. It can be one of the following:

- InProgress
- Succeeded
- Failed.

The vmSnapshot has a default deadline of 5 minutes. If the vmSnapshot has not successfully completed before the deadline, it will be marked as Failed. The VM will be unfrozen and the created snapshot content will be cleaned up if necessary. The vmSnapshot object will remain in Failed state until deleted by the user. To change the default deadline add 'FailureDeadline' to the VirtualMachineSnapshot spec with a new value. The allowed format is a [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) string which is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m"

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualMachineSnapshot
metadata:
  name: snap-larry
spec:
  source:
    apiGroup: kubevirt.io
    kind: VirtualMachine
    name: larry
  failureDeadline: 1m
```

In order to set an infinite deadline you can set it to 0 (not recommended).

To wait for a snapshot to complete, execute:

```bash
kubectl wait vmsnapshot snap-larry --for condition=Ready
```

You can verify your snapshot's state and composition by examining the following fields in the `snapshot.status`:

- `readyToUse` - indicates whether you can restore from the snapshot. It is possible that after the snapshot completed something happened to the volumeSnapshot (like someone deleted it by accident) making the snapshot unrestorable.
- `includedVolumes/excludedVolumes` - list of the volumes that were included or excluded in the snapshot, user should verify all the expected volumes are there.
- `indications` - array of indications that represents how the snapshot was taken:<br>
    - `Online` indicates the snapshot was taken while the VM was running.
    - `GuestAgent` indicates the QEMU guest agent was active and successfully froze (quiesced) the guest filesystem for the online snapshot. This delivers an application-consistent snapshot, ensuring high data integrity as if applications gracefully shut down before the snapshot.
    - `NoGuestAgent` indicates the QEMU guest agent was not installed, or not ready to quiesce the filesystem during the online snapshot. This results in a crash-consistent snapshot, capturing the VM's state like an abrupt power-off. There's no guarantee of application consistency, risking data issues for critical apps. Installing and running the guest agent, or retrying the snapshot, is highly recommended for better reliability.
    - `QuiesceFailed` indicates an attempt to freeze the filesystem failed during the online snapshot process. Even though the snapshot completed, it's not necessarily application-consistent. Retrying the snapshot is generally advisable to achieve proper consistency.

## Restoring a VirtualMachine

To restore the `VirtualMachine` `larry` from `VirtualMachineSnapshot` `snap-larry`, Stop the VM, wait for it to be stopped and then apply the following yaml.

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualMachineRestore
metadata:
  name: restore-larry
spec:
  target:
    apiGroup: kubevirt.io
    kind: VirtualMachine
    name: larry
  virtualMachineSnapshotName: snap-larry
```

To wait for a restore to complete, execute:

```bash
kubectl wait vmrestore restore-larry --for condition=Ready
```

## Target readiness policies

When restoring a `VirtualMachineSnapshot` on an already existing target (like the parent VM of the snapshot), a readiness policy can be specified to adjust how the restore happens if the target VM is not ready. The target VM is considered ready when it is fully stopped. The policy is controlled by setting `targetReadinessPolicy` to one of the available types.

The following policies are available:

- **WaitGracePeriod** (default policy): Wait 5 minutes for the target VM to be ready. If not ready in time, the restore will fail.
- **StopTarget**: Stop the target VM so that the restore can continue immediately.
- **FailImmediate**: Don't wait for the target to be ready before trying to restore. If it is not ready, the restore fails immediately.
- **WaitEventually**: Kubevirt keeps the `VirtualMachineRestore` around until the target is ready. The restore is started as soon as the target is ready.

## Volume restore policies

When restoring a `VirtualMachineSnapshot`, one of the steps is restoring the volumes of that snapshot. The `volumeRestorePolicy` setting gives the user some control on how that restore process is done.

The following policies are available:

- **RandomizeNames** (default policy): The names of restored PVCs are randomly generated using the UID of the restore job. This policy guarantees there's no collisions, but it may be a problem when using GitOps, as the IDs are not predictable.
- **InPlace**: This policy overwrites the original volumes with the restored ones. If the source PVCs still exist, they are **deleted before creating the restored PVCs**. It is useful when restoring over the original VM while wanting to keep the same volume names.

## Volume ownership policies

When restoring a `VirtualMachineSnapshot`, KubeVirt will try its best to find an owner for all the volumes restored.

The default policy is to give ownership of the restored volumes to the VM if no other owner can be found (for example, a parent DataVolume).
This behaviour might not be desired by the user, as deleting the restored VM will also propagate the deletion to the restored volumes.

The `.volumeOwnershipPolicy` field gives the user control over ownership of the restored volumes.

Policy **VM** (default policy) has the following behaviour:

- Volumes restored as part of the VM's `.dataVolumeTemplate` are owned by the `DataVolumes` of the `dataVolumeTemplate`
- Volumes that are `DataVolumes` are restored as PVCs, owned by the VM (because the original DataVolume is not kept)
- Volumes restored with `VolumeRestorePolicy` **InPlace** as part of `DataVolumes` are restored as PVCs, owned by the DataVolume (because the original DataVolume is rebound to the PVC)
- Volumes that are PVCs are restored as PVCs and owned by the VM

**Note**: This behaviour is altered by a [bug](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/12785) where this policy only applies correctly if the VM already exists, but the volumes have been deleted.

Policy **None** has the following behaviour:

- Volumes restored as part of the VM's `.dataVolumeTemplate` are owned by the `DataVolumes` of the `dataVolumeTemplate`
- Volumes that are `DataVolumes` are restored as PVCs, not owned by anything
- Volumes restored with `VolumeRestorePolicy` **InPlace** as part of `DataVolumes` are restored as PVCs, owned by the DataVolume (because the original DataVolume is rebound to the PVC)
- Volumes that are PVCs are restored as PVCs not owned by anything

## Volume restore overrides

When restoring a `VirtualMachineSnapshot`, the user might want to modify the volumes as they are being restored. This is possible using the `volumeRestoreOverrides`. Overrides are provided in a list, where each element targets a volume within the snapshot and applies changes to it.

The syntax for a volume restore override is the following:

```yaml
volumeRestoreOverrides:
  - volumeName: "original-volume" # Required - the original name of the volume within the snapshot
    # Optional - the new name of the restored volume
    # If combined with volumeRestorePolicy "InPlace", the PVC that has that name will be deleted before the volume is restored
    restoreName:
    # Optional - used to add or modify labels 
    labels:
      newLabel: "value"
      oldLabel: "newValue"
    # Optional - used to add or modify annotations
    annotations:
      newAnnotation: "value"
      oldAnnotation: "newValue"
```

## Restoring in a GitOps friendly way

Restoring VMs in KubeVirt may not be completely compatible with a GitOps workflow unless some adjustements are made.

The problem when restoring a VM "in place" (as in overwriting it with the content of the snapshot) is that the original VM gets modified with new information. For example, any volume mounted as a `DataVolume` is replaced by a PVC, and the names of all the volumes are changed with randomly generated UIDs.

This means that GitOps tools such as **ArgoCD** will report the original VM as *out of sync* and prompt the user the resynchronize it. If the VM is resynchronized, the restored volumes will end up unmounted and the VM will go back to its original state, which is usually not the intended effect.

To restore VMs while not causing desynchronization between the content of the Git and the cluster, it is recommended to apply the following changes to `VirtualMachineRestores`:

- Use `volumeRestorePolicy` **InPlace** so that volumes have a predictable name identical to the original volume
- Use `volumeRestoreOverrides` if you want to change the name of the restored volume
- Avoid using `dataVolumeTemplates` within VMs, as they get edited when the restored DataVolume is created (if not using `volumeRestorePolicy` InPlace)
- If using `DataVolumes`, mount them as `PersistentVolumeClaims` (DataVolumes create PVCs that have the same name as themselves, making both mount types compatible) 
 
```yaml
# This DataVolume can be mounted on the VM as a persistentVolumeClaim or as a dataVolume.
# It doesn't really change anything, as both mount types are compatible, but one is GitOps safe and the other is not.

---
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: volume
spec:
  ...

---
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      ...
      volumes:
      # This is not going to be overwritten by the VMRestore if volumeRestorePolicy is InPlace. It is GitOps-safe.
      - name: volume 
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: datavol
      # This will be transformed into the same volume mount as the one above, using a persistentVolumeName.
      # It will cause a desynchronization between the Git and the cluster. Avoid using this syntax.
      - name: volume
        dataVolume:
          name: datavol
```

## Cleanup

Keep `VirtualMachineSnapshots` (and their corresponding `VirtualMachineSnapshotContents`) around as long as you may want to restore from them again.

Feel free to delete `restore-larry` as it is not needed once the restore is complete.
