# Dedicated CPU resources

Certain workloads, requiring a predictable latency and enhanced
performance during its execution would benefit from obtaining dedicated
CPU resources. KubeVirt, relying on the Kubernetes CPU manager, is able
to pin guest's vCPUs to the host's pCPUs.

## [Kubernetes CPU manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/)

Kubernetes CPU manager is a mechanism that affects the scheduling of
workloads, placing it on a host which can allocate `Guaranteed`
resources and pin certain Pod's containers to host pCPUs, if the
following requirements are met:

* [Pod's QoS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-guaranteed) is Guaranteed
	* resources requests and limits are equal
	* all containers in the Pod express CPU and memory requirements
* Requested number of CPUs is an Integer

## Requesting dedicated CPU resources

Setting `spec.domain.cpu.dedicatedCpuPlacement` to `true` in a VMI spec
will indicate the desire to allocate dedicated CPU resource to the VMI

Kubevirt will verify that all the necessary conditions are met, for the
Kubernetes CPU manager to pin the virt-launcher container to dedicated
host CPUs. Once, virt-launcher is running, the VMI's vCPUs will be
pinned to the pCPUS that has been dedicated for the virt-launcher
container.

Expressing the desired amount of VMI's vCPUs can be done by either
setting the guest topology in `spec.domain.cpu` (`sockets`, `cores`,
`threads`) or `spec.domain.resources.[requests/limits].cpu` to a whole
number integer ([1-9]+) indicating the number of vCPUs
requested for the VMI. Number of vCPUs is counted as
`sockets * cores * threads` or if `spec.domain.cpu` is empty then it
takes value from `spec.domain.resources.requests.cpu` or
`spec.domain.resources.limits.cpu`.

> **Note:** Users should not specify both `spec.domain.cpu` and
> `spec.domain.resources.[requests/limits].cpu`
>
> **Note:** `spec.domain.resources.requests.cpu` must be equal to
> `spec.domain.resources.limits.cpu`
>
> **Note:** Multiple cpu-bound microbenchmarks show a significant
> performance advantage when using `spec.domain.cpu.sockets` instead of
> `spec.domain.cpu.cores`.

All inconsistent requirements will be rejected.

    apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
    kind: VirtualMachineInstance
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          sockets: 2
          cores: 1
          threads: 1
          dedicatedCpuPlacement: true
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 2Gi
    [...]

OR

    apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
    kind: VirtualMachineInstance
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          dedicatedCpuPlacement: true
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 2
            memory: 2Gi
    [...]

## Requesting dedicated CPU for QEMU emulator

A number of QEMU threads, such as QEMU main event loop, async I/O
operation completion, etc., also execute on the same physical CPUs as
the VMI's vCPUs. This may affect the expected latency of a vCPU. In
order to enhance the real-time support in KubeVirt and provide improved
latency, KubeVirt will allocate an additional dedicated CPU, exclusively
for the emulator thread, to which it will be pinned. This will
effectively "isolate" the emulator thread from the vCPUs of the VMI.
In case `ioThreadsPolicy` is set to `auto` IOThreads will also be
"isolated" and placed on the same physical CPU as the QEMU emulator thread.

This functionality can be enabled by specifying
`isolateEmulatorThread: true` inside VMI spec's `Spec.Domain.CPU`
section. Naturally, this setting has to be specified in a combination
with a `dedicatedCpuPlacement: true`.

Example:

    apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
    kind: VirtualMachineInstance
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          dedicatedCpuPlacement: true
          isolateEmulatorThread: true
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 2
            memory: 2Gi

When the following conditions are met:
- The compute node has [SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading) enabled
- Kubelet's CPUManager policy is set to static - [full-pcpus-only](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/#static-policy-options)
- The VM is configured to have an even number of CPUs
- `dedicatedCpuPlacement` and `isolateEmulatorThread` are enabled

The VM is scheduled, but rejected by the kubelet with the following event:
```
SMT Alignment Error: requested 3 cpus not multiple cpus per core = 2
```

In order to address this issue:
1. Enable the `CPUManagerPolicyBetaOptions` feature gate in the KubeVirt CR.
2. Add the following annotation to the VMI:
```yaml
kubevirt.io/CPUManagerPolicyBetaOptions: full-pcpus-only
```

It will cause KubeVirt to allocate two dedicated CPUs for the emulator thread isolation instead of the default single CPU.

## Identifying nodes with a running CPU manager

At this time, [Kubernetes doesn't label the
nodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/66525) that has
CPU manager running on it.

KubeVirt has a mechanism to identify which nodes has the CPU manager
running and manually add a `cpumanager=true` label. This label will be
removed when KubeVirt will identify that CPU manager is no longer
running on the node. This automatic identification should be viewed as a
temporary workaround until Kubernetes will provide the required
functionality. Therefore, this feature should be manually enabled by
activating the `CPUManager`
[feature gate](../operations/activating_feature_gates.md#how-to-activate-a-feature-gate)
to the KubeVirt CR.

When automatic identification is disabled, cluster administrator may
manually add the above label to all the nodes when CPU Manager is
running.

-   Nodes' labels are view-able: `kubectl describe nodes`

-   Administrators may manually label a missing node:
    `kubectl label node [node_name] cpumanager=true`


## Sidecar containers and CPU allocation overhead

**Note:** In order to run sidecar containers, KubeVirt requires the
`Sidecar`
[feature gate](../operations/activating_feature_gates.md#how-to-activate-a-feature-gate)
to be enabled in KubeVirt's CR.

According to the Kubernetes CPU manager model, in order the POD would
reach the required QOS level `Guaranteed`, all containers in the POD
must express CPU and memory requirements. At this time, Kubevirt often
uses a sidecar container to mount VMI's registry disk. It also uses a
sidecar container of it's hooking mechanism. These additional resources
can be viewed as an overhead and should be taken into account when
calculating a node capacity.

**Note:** The current defaults for sidecar's resources: `CPU: 200m`
`Memory: 64M` As the CPU resource is not expressed as a whole number,
CPU manager will not attempt to pin the sidecar container to a host CPU.
