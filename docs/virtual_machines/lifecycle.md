# Lifecycle

Every `VirtualMachineInstance` represents a single virtual machine
*instance*. In general, the management of VirtualMachineInstances is
kept similar to how `Pods` are managed: Every VM that is defined in the
cluster is expected to be running, just like Pods. Deleting a
VirtualMachineInstance is equivalent to shutting it down, this is also
equivalent to how Pods behave.


## Launching a virtual machine

In order to start a VirtualMachineInstance, you just need to create a
`VirtualMachineInstance` object using `kubectl`:

    $ kubectl create -f vmi.yaml


## Listing virtual machines

VirtualMachineInstances can be listed by querying for
VirtualMachineInstance objects:

    $ kubectl get vmis


## Retrieving a virtual machine definition

A single VirtualMachineInstance definition can be retrieved by getting
the specific VirtualMachineInstance object:

    $ kubectl get vmis testvmi


## Stopping a virtual machine

To stop the VirtualMachineInstance, you just need to delete the
corresponding `VirtualMachineInstance` object using `kubectl`.

    $ kubectl delete -f vmi.yaml
    # OR
    $ kubectl delete vmis testvmi

> Note: Stopping a VirtualMachineInstance implies that it will be
> deleted from the cluster. You will not be able to start this
> VirtualMachineInstance object again.


## Pausing and unpausing a virtual machine

> Note: Pausing in this context refers to libvirt's `virDomainSuspend` command:  
> "The process is frozen without further access to CPU resources and I/O but the memory used by the domain at the hypervisor level will stay allocated"

To pause a virtual machine, you need the `virtctl` command line tool. Its `pause` command works on either `VirtualMachine` s
or `VirtualMachinesInstance` s:

    $ virtctl pause vm testvm
    # OR
    $ virtctl pause vmi testvm

Paused VMIs have a `Paused` condition in their status:

    $ kubectl get vmi testvm -o=jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Paused")].message}'
    VMI was paused by user

Unpausing works similar to pausing:

    $ virtctl unpause vm testvm
    # OR
    $ virtctl unpause vmi testvm


## Renaming a Virtual Machine

> Note: Renaming a Virtual Machine is only possible when a Virtual Machine
> is stopped, or has a 'Halted' run strategy.

    $ virtctl rename vm_name new_vm_name
