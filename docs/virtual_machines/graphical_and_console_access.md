# Graphical and Serial Console Access

Once a virtual machine is started you are able to connect to the
consoles it exposes. Usually there are two types of consoles:

-   Serial Console
-   Graphical Console (VNC)

> Note: You need to have `virtctl`
> [installed](/installation/?id=client-side-virtctl-deployment) to gain
> access to the VirtualMachineInstance.


## Accessing the serial console

The serial console of a virtual machine can be accessed by using the
`console` command:

    $ virtctl console --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG testvmi


## Accessing the graphical console (VNC)

Accessing the graphical console of a virtual machine is usually done
through VNC, which requires `remote-viewer`. Once the tool is installed
you can access the graphical console using:

    $ virtctl vnc --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG testvmi

If you need to open only a vnc-proxy without executing the `remote-viewer` command, it can be done using:

    $ virtctl vnc --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG --proxy-only testvmi

this would print the port number on your machine where you can manually connect using any of the vnc viewers

## Debugging console access

Should the connection fail, you can use the `-v` flag to get more output
from both `virtctl` and the `remote-viewer` tool, to troubleshoot the
problem.

    $ virtctl vnc --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG testvmi -v 4

> **Note:** If you are using virtctl via ssh on a remote machine, you
> need to forward the X session to your machine (Look up the -X and -Y
> flags of `ssh` if you are not familiar with that). As an alternative
> you can proxy the apiserver port with ssh to your machine (either
> direct or in combination with `kubectl proxy`)


### RBAC Permissions for Console/VNC Access

#### Using Default RBAC ClusterRoles

Every KubeVirt installation after version v0.5.1 comes a set of default
RBAC cluster roles that can be used to grant users access to
VirtualMachineInstances.

The **kubevirt.io:admin** and **kubevirt.io:edit** ClusterRoles have
console and VNC access permissions built into them. By binding either of
these roles to a user, they will have the ability to use virtctl to
access console and VNC.


#### With Custom RBAC ClusterRole

The default KubeVirt ClusterRoles give access to more than just console
in VNC. In the event that an Admin would like to craft a custom role
that targets only console and VNC, the ClusterRole below demonstrates
how that can be done.

    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: allow-vnc-console-access
    rules:
      - apiGroups:
          - subresources.kubevirt.io
        resources:
          - virtualmachineinstances/console
          - virtualmachineinstances/vnc
        verbs:
          - get

The ClusterRole above provides access to virtual machines across all
namespaces.

In order to reduce the scope to a single namespace, bind this
ClusterRole using a RoleBinding that targets a single namespace.
