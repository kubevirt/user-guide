# Architecture

## VirtualMachine

A `VirtualMachine` provides additional management capabilities to a
VirtualMachineInstance inside the cluster. That includes:

-   ABI stability

-   Start/stop/restart capabilities on the controller level

-   Offline configuration change with propagation on
    VirtualMachineInstance recreation

-   Ensure that the VirtualMachineInstance is running if it should be
    running

It focuses on a 1:1 relationship between the controller instance and a
virtual machine instance. In many ways it is very similar to a
[StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
with `spec.replica` set to `1`.

## How to use a VirtualMachine

A VirtualMachine will make sure that a VirtualMachineInstance object
with an identical name will be present in the cluster, if `spec.running`
is set to `true`. Further it will make sure that a
VirtualMachineInstance will be removed from the cluster if
`spec.running` is set to `false`.

There exists a field `spec.runStrategy` which can also be used to
control the state of the associated VirtualMachineInstance object. To
avoid confusing and contradictory states, these fields are mutually
exclusive.

An extended explanation of `spec.runStrategy` vs `spec.running` can be
found in [Run Strategies](../virtual_machines/run_strategies)

### Starting and stopping

After creating a VirtualMachine it can be switched on or off like this:

    # Start the virtual machine:
    virtctl start vm

    # Stop the virtual machine:
    virtctl stop vm

`kubectl` can be used too:

    # Start the virtual machine:
    kubectl patch virtualmachine vm --type merge -p \
        '{"spec":{"running":true}}'

    # Stop the virtual machine:
    kubectl patch virtualmachine vm --type merge -p \
        '{"spec":{"running":false}}'

### Controller status

Once a VirtualMachineInstance is created, its state will be tracked via
`status.created` and `status.ready` fields of the VirtualMachine. If a
VirtualMachineInstance exists in the cluster, `status.created` will equal
`true`. If the VirtualMachineInstance is also ready, `status.ready` will
equal `true` too.

If a VirtualMachineInstance reaches a final state but the `spec.running`
equals `true`, the VirtualMachine controller will set `status.ready` to
`false` and re-create the VirtualMachineInstance.

Additionally, the `status.printableStatus` field provides high-level summary
information about the state of the VirtualMachine. This information is also displayed
when listing VirtualMachines using the CLI:

```
$ kubectl get virtualmachines
NAME     AGE   STATUS    VOLUME
vm1      4m    Running
vm2      11s   Stopped
```

Here's the list of states currently supported and their meanings.
Note that states may be added/removed in future releases, so caution
should be used if consumed by automated programs.

 - **Stopped**: The virtual machine is currently stopped and isn't expected to start.
 - **Provisioning**: Cluster resources associated with the virtual machine (e.g., DataVolumes) are being provisioned and prepared.
 - **Starting**: The virtual machine is being prepared for running.
 - **Running**: The virtual machine is running.
 - **Paused**: The virtual machine is paused.
 - **Migrating**: The virtual machine is in the process of being migrated to another host.
 - **Stopping**: The virtual machine is in the process of being stopped.
 - **Terminating**: The virtual machine is in the process of deletion, as well as its associated resources (VirtualMachineInstance, DataVolumes, â€¦).
 - **Unknown**: The state of the virtual machine could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host on which it's running.


### Restarting

A VirtualMachineInstance restart can be triggered by deleting the
VirtualMachineInstance. This will also propagate configuration changes
from the template in the VirtualMachine:

    # Restart the virtual machine (you delete the instance!):
    kubectl delete virtualmachineinstance vm

To restart a VirtualMachine named vm using virtctl:

    $ virtctl restart vm

This would perform a normal restart for the VirtualMachineInstance and
would reschedule the VirtualMachineInstance on a new virt-launcher Pod

To force restart a VirtualMachine named vm using virtctl:

    $ virtctl restart vm --force --grace-period=0

This would try to perform a normal restart, and would also delete the
virt-launcher Pod of the VirtualMachineInstance with setting
GracePeriodSeconds to the seconds passed in the command.

Currently, only setting grace-period=0 is supported.

> Note: Force restart can cause data corruption, and should be used in
> cases of kernel panic or VirtualMachine being unresponsive to normal
> restarts.

### Fencing considerations

A VirtualMachine will never restart or re-create a
VirtualMachineInstance until the current instance of the
VirtualMachineInstance is deleted from the cluster.

### Exposing as a Service

A VirtualMachine can be exposed as a service. The actual service will be
available once the VirtualMachineInstance starts without additional
interaction.

For example, exposing SSH port (22) as a `ClusterIP` service using `virtctl`
after the VirtualMachine was created, but before it started:

    $ virtctl expose virtualmachine vmi-ephemeral --name vmiservice --port 27017 --target-port 22

All service exposure options that apply to a VirtualMachineInstance apply to a VirtualMachine.

See [Service Objects](../virtual_machines/service_objects) for more details.

## When to use a VirtualMachine

### When ABI stability is required between restarts

A `VirtualMachine` makes sure that VirtualMachineInstance ABI
configurations are consistent between restarts. A classical example are
licenses which are bound to the firmware UUID of a virtual machine. The
`VirtualMachine` makes sure that the UUID will always stay the same
without the user having to take care of it.

One of the main benefits is that a user can still make use of defaulting
logic, although a stable ABI is needed.

### When config updates should be picked up on the next restart

If the VirtualMachineInstance configuration should be modifiable inside
the cluster and these changes should be picked up on the next
VirtualMachineInstance restart. This means that no hotplug is involved.

### When you want to let the cluster manage your individual VirtualMachineInstance

Kubernetes as a declarative system can help you to manage the
VirtualMachineInstance. You tell it that you want this
VirtualMachineInstance with your application running, the VirtualMachine
will try to make sure it stays running.

> Note: The current belief is that if it is defined that the
> VirtualMachineInstance should be running, it should be running. This is
> different to many classical virtualization platforms, where VMs stay
> down if they were switched off. Restart policies may be added if needed.
> Please provide your use-case if you need this!

          disks:

            name: containerdisk
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: cloudinitdisk
        machine:
          type: ""
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 64M
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
      volumes:
      - name: containerdisk
        containerDisk:
          image: kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:latest

        name: cloudinitdisk
```

Saving this manifest into `vm.yaml` and submitting it to Kubernetes will
create the controller instance:

```
$ kubectl create -f vm.yaml
virtualmachine "vm-cirros" created
```

Since `spec.running` is set to `false`, no vmi will be created:

```
$ kubectl get vmis
No resources found.
```

Let's start the VirtualMachine:

```
$ virtctl start vm vm-cirros
```

As expected, a VirtualMachineInstance called `vm-cirros` got created:

```
$ kubectl describe vm vm-cirros

### Kubectl commandline interactions

Whenever you want to manipulate the VirtualMachine through the
commandline you can use the kubectl command. The following are examples
demonstrating how to do it.

```
    # Define a virtual machine:
    kubectl create -f vm.yaml

    # Start the virtual machine:
    kubectl patch virtualmachine vm --type merge -p \
        '{"spec":{"running":true}}'

    # Look at virtual machine status and associated events:
    kubectl describe virtualmachine vm

    # Look at the now created virtual machine instance status and associated events:
    kubectl describe virtualmachineinstance vm

    # Stop the virtual machine instance:
    kubectl patch virtualmachine vm --type merge -p \
        '{"spec":{"running":false}}'

    # Restart the virtual machine (you delete the instance!):
    kubectl delete virtualmachineinstance vm

    # Implicit cascade delete (first deletes the virtual machine and then the virtual machine instance)
    kubectl delete virtualmachine vm

    # Explicit cascade delete (first deletes the virtual machine and then the virtual machine instance)
    kubectl delete virtualmachine vm --cascade=true

    # Orphan delete (The running virtual machine is only detached, not deleted)
    # Recreating the virtual machine would lead to the adoption of the virtual machine instance
    kubectl delete virtualmachine vm --cascade=false
```
