# Web Console

## Managing Virtual Machines

### Creating a Virtual Machine with the Interactive Wizard

The web console features an interactive wizard that guides you through
[**Basic Settings**](#virtual-machine-wizard-fields),
[**Networking**](#networking-fields), and
[**Storage**](#storage-fields) screens to simplify the
process of creating virtual machines. All required fields are marked
with a `*`. The wizard prevents you from moving to the next screen until
the required fields have been completed.

NICs and storage disks can be created and attached to virtual machines
after they have been created.

****Bootable Disk**.**

If either `URL` or `Container` are selected as the **Provision Source**
in the [**Basic Settings**](#virtual-machine-wizard-fields) screen, a `rootdisk`
disk is created and attached to the virtual machine as the **Bootable
Disk**. You can modify the `rootdisk` but you cannot remove it.

A **Bootable Disk** is not required for virtual machines provisioned
from a **PXE** source if there are no disks attached to the virtual
machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you
must select one as the **Bootable Disk**.

1.  Click **Workloads** → **Virtual Machines** from the side menu.

2.  Click **Create Virtual Machine** and select **Create with Wizard**.

3.  Fill in all required [**Basic Settings**](#virtual-machine-wizard-fields).
    Selecting a **Template** automatically fills in these fields.

4.  Click **Next** to progress to the
    [**Networking**](#networking-fields) screen. A `nic0` NIC
    is attached by default.

    1.  (Optional) Click **Create NIC** to create additional NICs.

    2.  (Optional) You can remove any or all NICs by clicking the ⋮
        button and selecting **Remove NIC**. A virtual machine does not
        need a NIC attached to be created. NICs can be
        [created](#vm-create-nic-web) after the virtual machine has been
        created.

5.  Click **Next** to progress to the
    [**Storage**](#storage-fields) screen.

    1.  (Optional) Click **Create Disk** to create additional disks.
        These disks can be removed by clicking the ⋮ button and
        selecting **Remove Disk**.

    2.  (Optional) Click on a disk to modify available fields. Click the
        ✓ button to save the update.

    3.  (Optional) Click **Attach Disk** to choose an available disk
        from the **Select Storage** drop-down list.

6.  Click **Create Virtual Machine &gt;**. The **Results** screen
    displays the JSON configuration file for the virtual machine.

The virtual machine should now be listed in **Workloads** → **Virtual
Machines**.

### Creating a Virtual Machine Using a YAML Configuration File

A virtual machine can also be created by writing or pasting a YAML
configuration file in the web console in the **Workloads** → **Virtual
Machines** screen. A valid `example` virtual machine configuration is
provided by default whenever you open the YAML edit screen.

If your YAML configuration is invalid when you click **Create**, an
error message indicates the parameter in which the error occurs. Only
one error is shown at a time.

> Note: Navigating away from the YAML screen while editing cancels any
> changes to the configuration you have made.

1.  Click **Workloads** → **Virtual Machines** from the side menu.

2.  Click **Create Virtual Machine** and select **Create from YAML**.

3.  Write or paste your virtual machine configuration in the editable
    window.

    1.  Alternatively, use the `example` virtual machine provided by
        default in the YAML screen.

4.  (Optional) Click **Download** to download the YAML configuration
    file to your local machine in its present state.

5.  Click **Create** to create the virtual machine.

The virtual machine should now be listed in **Workloads** → **Virtual
Machines**.

### Editing a Virtual Machine

You can edit some values of a virtual machine in the web console, either
by editing the [YAML directly](#editing-vm-yaml-web), or from the
**Virtual Machine Overview** screen.

When editing from the **Virtual Machine Overview** screen, the virtual
machine must be **Off**.

1.  Click **Workloads** → **Virtual Machines** from the side menu.

2.  Select a Virtual Machine.

3.  Click **Edit** to make editable fields available.

## Virtual Machine Templates in the Web Console

### Creating a Virtual Machine Template with the Interactive Wizard

Virtual machine templates are an easy way to create multiple virtual
machines with similar configuration. After a template is created,
reference the template when [creating virtual
machines](#creating-vm-wizard-web).

The web console features an interactive wizard that guides you through
[**Basic Settings**](#template-wizard-fields-web),
[**Networking**](#networking-fields), and
[**Storage**](#storage-fields) screens to simplify the
process of creating virtual machine templates. All required fields are
marked with a `*`. The wizard prevents you from moving to the next
screen until the required fields have been completed.

NICs and storage disks can be created and attached to virtual machines
after they have been created.

****Bootable Disk**.**

If either `URL` or `Container` are selected as the **Provision Source**
in the [**Basic Settings**](#template-wizard-fields-web) screen, a
`rootdisk` disk is created and attached to virtual machines as the
**Bootable Disk**. You can modify the `rootdisk` but you cannot remove
it.

A **Bootable Disk** is not required for virtual machines provisioned
from a **PXE** source if there are no disks attached to the virtual
machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you
must select one as the **Bootable Disk**.

1.  Click **Workloads** → **Virtual Machine Templates** from the side

### PXE Booting with a Specified MAC Address

Network booting allows a computer to boot and load an operating system
or other program without requiring a locally attached storage device.
For example, you can use it to choose your desired OS image from a PXE
server when deploying a new host.

1. Configure a PXE network on the cluster:

    1.  Create **NetworkAttachmentDefinition** of PXE network
        `pxe-net-conf`:

            apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
            kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
            metadata:
              name: pxe-net-conf
            spec:
              config: '{
                  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
                  "type": "ovs",
                  "bridge": "br1"
                }'

        > Note: In this example, the virtual machine instance (VMI) will
        > be attached through a trunk port to the Open vSwitch bridge
        > `<br1>`.

    2.  Create Open vSwitch bridge `<br1>` and connect it to interface
        `<eth1>`, which is connected to a network that allows for PXE
        booting:

            $ ovs-vsctl add-br br1
            $ ovs-vsctl add-port br1 eth1
            $ ovs-vsctl show
            8d004495-ea9a-44e1-b00c-3b65648dae5f
                Bridge br1
                    Port br1
                        Interface br1
                            type: internal
                    Port "eth1"
                        Interface "eth1"
                ovs_version: "2.8.1"

        > Note: This bridge must be configured on all nodes. If it is
        > only available on a subset of nodes, make sure that VMIs have
        > **nodeSelector** constraints in place.

2.  Edit the virtual machine instance configuration file to include the
    details of the interface and network.

    1.  Specify the network and MAC address if required by the PXE
        server. A value is assigned automatically if the MAC address is
        not specified; however, note that at this time, MAC addresses
        that are assigned automatically are not persistent.

        Ensure that `bootOrder` is set to `1` so that the interface
        boots first. In this example, the interface is connected to a
        network called `<pxe-net>`:

            interfaces:
            - masquerade: {}
              name: default
            - bridge: {}
              name: pxe-net
              macAddress: de:00:00:00:00:de
              bootOrder: 1

        > Note: Boot order is global for interfaces and disks.

    2.  Assign a boot device number to the disk to ensure proper booting
        after OS provisioning.

        Set the disk `bootOrder` value to `2`:

            devices:
              disks:
              - disk:
                  bus: virtio
                name: containerdisk
                bootOrder: 2

    3.  Specify that the network is connected to the previously created
        **NetworkAttachmentDefinition**. In this scenario, `<pxe-net>`
        is connected to the **NetworkAttachmentDefinition** called
        `<pxe-net-conf>`:

            networks:
            - name: default
              pod: {}
            - name: pxe-net
              multus:
                networkName: pxe-net-conf

3.  Create the virtual machine instance:

        $ oc create -f vmi-pxe-boot.yaml
        virtualmachineinstance.kubevirt.io "vmi-pxe-boot" created

4.  Wait for the virtual machine instance to run:

        $ oc get vmi vmi-pxe-boot -o yaml | grep -i phase
          phase: Running

5.  View the virtual machine instance using VNC:

        $ virtctl vnc vmi-pxe-boot

6.  Watch the boot screen to verify that the PXE boot is successful.

7.  Log in to the VMI:

        $ virtctl console vmi-pxe-boot

8.  Verify the interfaces and MAC address on the VM, and that the
    interface connected to the bridge has the specified MAC address. In
    this case, we used `eth1` for the PXE boot, without an IP address.
    The other

        $ ip addr
        ...
        3. eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
           link/ether de:00:00:00:00:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
