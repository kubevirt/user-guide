Installation
------------

KubeVirt is a virtualization add-on to Kubernetes and this guide assumes
that a Kubernetes cluster is already installed.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few requirements need to be met before you can begin:

* https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] cluster
(https://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift], Tectonic)
* `kubectl` client utility
* `git`

Minimum Cluster Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kubernetes 1.10 or later is required to run KubeVirt.

In addition it can be that feature gates need to be opened.

Runtime
+++++++

KubeVirt is currently support on the following container runtimes:

* docker
* crio (with runv)

Virtualization support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several distributions of Kubernetes, you need to decide on one
and deploy it.

Hardware with virtualization support is recommended. You can use
virt-host-validate to ensure that your hosts are capable of running
virtualization workloads:

[source,bash]
----
$ virt-host-validate qemu
  QEMU: Checking for hardware virtualization                                 : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/kvm exists                                   : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/kvm is accessible                            : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/vhost-net exists                             : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/net/tun exists                               : PASS
...
----

Software emulation
++++++++++++++++++

If hardware virtualization is not available, then a
https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/master/docs/software-emulation.md[software
emulation fallback] can be enabled using:

....
$ kubectl configmap -n kube-system kubevirt-config \
    --from-literal debug.allowEmulation=true
....

This ConfigMap needs to be created before deployment or the
virt-controller deployment has to be restarted.

Hugepages support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For hugepages support you need at least Kubernetes version `1.9`.

Enable feature-gate
+++++++++++++++++++

To enable hugepages on Kubernetes, check the
https://v1-9.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-hugepages/scheduling-hugepages/#before-you-begin[official
documentation].

To enable hugepages on OpenShift, check the
https://docs.openshift.org/3.9/scaling_performance/managing_hugepages.html#huge-pages-prerequisites[official
documentation].

Pre-allocate hugepages on a node
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To pre-allocate hugepages on boot time, you will need to specify
hugepages under kernel boot parameters `hugepagesz=2M hugepages=64` and
restart your machine.

You can find more about hugepages under
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt[official
documentation].

Cluster side add-on deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Core components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once Kubernetes is deployed, you will need to deploy the KubeVirt
add-on. The add-on is deployed to a cluster using the `kubectl` tool and
manifest file:

[source,bash]
----
$ RELEASE=v0.4.0
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/${RELEASE}/kubevirt.yaml
----

This command will deploy the most recent stable version of KubeVirt to
your cluster. The new components will be deployed in the `kube-system`
namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
NAME                                           READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
libvirt-9zmtl                                  2/2       Running       0          28m
virt-controller-5d9fc8cf8b-n5trt               0/1       Running       0          27m
virt-handler-vwdjx                             1/1       Running       0          28m
----

Client side `virtctl` deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic VirtualMachineInstance operations can be performed with the stock
`kubectl` utility. However, the `virtctl` binary utility is required to
use advanced features such as:

* Serial and graphical console access

It also provides convenience commands for:

* Starting and stopping VirtualMachineInstances
* Live migrating VirtualMachineInstances

The most recent version of the tool can be retrieved from the
https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases[official release page].

Deploying on OpenShift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three ways to deploy KubeVirt on OpenShift.

Using command line interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/admin_guide/manage_scc.html[SCCs]
need to be added prior `kubevirt.yaml` deployment:

[source,bash]
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -n kube-system -z kubevirt-privileged
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -n kube-system -z kubevirt-controller
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -n kube-system -z kubevirt-apiserver
----

Once privileges are granted, the `kubevirt.yaml` can be deployed:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/${RELEASE}/kubevirt.yaml
----

From Service Catalog as an APB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can find KubeVirt in the OpenShift Service Catalog and install it
from there. In order to do that please follow the documentation in the
https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/kubevirt-apb[KubeVirt APB
repository].

Using Ansible playbooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt-ansible[kubevirt-ansible]
project provides a collection of playbooks that installs KubeVirt and
itâ€™s related components on top of OpenShift or Kubernetes clusters.

Deploying from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the
https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md[Developer
Getting Started Guide] to understand how to build and deploy KubeVirt
from source.

Update
~~~~~~

____________________________________
Note: Updates are not yet supported.
____________________________________

Usually it is sufficient to re-apply the manifests for performing a
rolling update:

[source,bash]
----
$ RELEASE=v0.4.0
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/${RELEASE}/kubevirt.yaml
----
