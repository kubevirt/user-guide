KubeVirt API Validation
-----------------------

The KubeVirt VirtualMachineInstance API is implemented using a
Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Because of this, KubeVirt
is able to leverage a couple of features Kubernetes provides in order to
perform validation checks on our API as objects created and updated on
the cluster.

How API Validation Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CRD OpenAPIv3 Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The KubeVirt API is registered with Kubernetes at install time through a
series of CRD definitions. KubeVirt includes an OpenAPIv3 schema in
these definitions which indicates to the Kubernetes Apiserver some very
basic information about our API, such as what fields are required and
what type of data is expected for each value.

This OpenAPIv3 schema validation is installed automatically and requires
no thought on the users part to enable.

Admission Control Webhooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OpenAPIv3 schema validation is limited. It only validates the
general structure of a KubeVirt object looks correct. It does not
however verify that the contents of that object make sense.

With OpenAPIv3 validation alone, users can easily make simple mistakes
(like not referencing a volumeName correctly with a disk) and the
cluster will still accept the object. However, the
VirtualMachineInstance will of course not start if these errors in the
API exist. Ideally we’d like to catch configuration issues as early as
possible and not allow an object to even be posted to the cluster if we
can detect there’s a problem with the object’s Spec.

In order to perform this advanced validation, KubeVirt implements its
own admission controller which is registered with kubernetes as an
admission controller webhook. This webhook is registered with Kubernetes
at install time. As KubeVirt objects are posted to the cluster, the
Kubernetes API server forwards Creation requests to our webhook for
validation before persisting the object into storage.

Note however that the KubeVirt admission controller requires features to
be enabled on the cluster in order to be enabled.

Enabling KubeVirt Admission Controller on Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When provisioning a new Kubernetes cluster, ensure that both the
*MutatingAdmissionWebhook* and *ValidatingAdmissionWebhook* values are
present in the Apiserver’s *–admission-control* cli argument.

Below is an example of the *–admission-control* values we use during
development

....
--admission-control='Initializers,NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,NodeRestriction,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,ResourceQuota'
....

Enabling KubeVirt Admission Controller on OpenShift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenShift also requires the admission control webhooks to be enabled at
install time. The process is slightly different though. With OpenShift,
we enable webhooks using an admission plugin.

These admission control plugins can be configured in openshift-ansible
by setting the following value in ansible inventory file.

....
openshift_master_admission_plugin_config={"ValidatingAdmissionWebhook":{"configuration":{"kind": "DefaultAdmissionConfig","apiVersion": "v1","disable": false}},"MutatingAdmissionWebhook":{"configuration":{"kind": "DefaultAdmissionConfig","apiVersion": "v1","disable": false}}}
....
