Controllers
-----------

Controllers provide the logic to manage virtual machine instances in a
way that addresses specific use-cases:

* link:workloads/controllers/virtual-machine-replica-set[VirtualMachineInstanceReplicaSet]:
Replicating stateless Virtual Machines.
* link:workloads/controllers/virtual-machine[VirtualMachine]: Stateful
Virtual Machine, similar to a StatefulSet with replicas set to 1.
