Assigning VMs to Nodes
----------------------

You can constrain the VM to only run on specific nodes or to prefer
running on specific nodes:

* *nodeSelector*
* *Affinity and anti-affinity*
* *Taints and Tolerations*

nodeSelector
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting `spec.nodeSelector` requirements, constrains the scheduler to
only schedule VMs on nodes, which contain the specified labels. In the
following example the vmi contains the labels `cpu: slow` and
`storage: fast`:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: testvmi-ephemeral
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    cpu: slow
    storage: fast
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
----

Thus the scheduler will only schedule the vmi to nodes which contain
these labels in their metadata. It works exactly like the Pods
`nodeSelector`. See the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector[Pod
nodeSelector Documentation] for more examples.

Affinity and anti-affinity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `spec.affinity` field allows specifying hard- and soft-affinity for
VMs. It is possible to write matching rules agains workloads (VMs and
Pods) and Nodes. Since VMs are a workload type based on Pods,
Pod-affinity affects VMs as well.

An example for `podAffinity` and `podAntiAffinity` may look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: testvmi-ephemeral
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    cpu: slow
    storage: fast
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:
            - S1
        topologyKey: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
    podAntiAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        podAffinityTerm:
          labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: security
              operator: In
              values:
              - S2
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
----

Affinity and anti-affinity works exactly like the Pods `affinity`. This
includes `podAffinity`, `podAntiAffinity`, `nodeAffinity` and
`nodeAntiAffinity`. See the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity[Pod
affinity and anti-affinity Documentation] for more examples and details.

Taints and Tolerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Affinity as described above, is a property of VMs that attracts them to
a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement). Taints
are the opposite â€“ they allow a node to repel a set of VMs.

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that VMs are not
scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a
node; this marks that the node should not accept any VMs that do not
tolerate the taints. Tolerations are applied to VMs, and allow (but do
not require) the VMs to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint. For example,

[source,bash]
----
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
----

An example for `tolerations` may look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: testvmi-ephemeral
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    cpu: slow
    storage: fast
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
