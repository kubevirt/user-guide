Interfaces and Networks
-----------------------

Connecting a virtual machine to a network consists of two parts. First,
networks are specified in `spec.networks`. Then, interfaces backed by
the networks are added to the VM by specifying them in
`spec.domain.devices.interfaces`.

Each interface must have a corresponding network with the same name.

An `interface` defines a virtual network interface of a virtual machine
(also called a frontend). A `network` specifies the backend of an
`interface` and declares which logical or physical device it is
connected to (also called as backend).

There are multiple ways of configuring an `interface` as well as a
`network`.

All possible configuration options are available in the
https://kubevirt.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_interface[Interface
API Reference] and
https://kubevirt.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_network[Network
API Reference].

____________________________________________________________
*Note:* Currently, the only supported network type is `pod`.
____________________________________________________________

Backend
~~~~~~~

Network backends are configured in `spec.networks`. A network must have
a unique name. Additional fields declare which logical or physical
device the network relates to.

A `pod` network represents the default pod `eth0` interface configured
by cluster SDN solution that is present in each pod.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note:* Currently, the only supported network type is `pod`. In the
future, more network types may be supported.

Frontend
~~~~~~~~

Network interfaces are configured in `spec.domain.devices.interfaces`.
They describe properties of virtual interfaces as ``seen'' inside guest
instances. The same network backend may be connected to a virtual
machine in multiple different ways, each with their own connectivity
guarantees and characteristics.

Each interface should declare its type by defining on of the following
fields:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|================================================
|Type |Description
|`bridge` |Connect using a linux bridge
|`slirp` |Connect using QEMU user networking mode
|================================================

Each interface may also have additional configuration fields that modify
properties ``seen'' inside guest instances, as listed below:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Format |Default value |Description
|`model` |One of: `e1000`, `e1000e`, `ne2k_pci`, `pcnet`, `rtl8139`,
`virtio` |`virtio` |NIC type

|macAddress |`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` or `FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF` | |MAC address
as seen inside the guest system, for example: `de:ad:00:00:be:af`

|ports | |empty |List of ports to be forwarded to the virtual machine.

|pciAddress |`0000:81:00.1` | |Set network interface PCI address, for
example: `0000:81:00.1`
|=======================================================================

Ports
^^^^^

Declare ports listen by the virtual machine

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note:* When using the slirp interface only the configured ports will be
forwarded to the virtual machine.

|Name |Format |Required |Description
|`name` | |no |Name
|`port` |1 - 65535 |yes |Port to expose
|`protocol` |TCP,UDP |no |Connection protocol
|============================================

______________________________________________________________________________
*Tip:* Use `e1000` model if your guest image doesn’t ship with virtio
drivers.
______________________________________________________________________________

If `spec.domain.devices.interfaces` is omitted, the virtual machine is
connected using the default pod network interface of `bridge` type. If
you’d like to have a virtual machine instance without any network
connectivity, you can use the `autoattachPodInterface` field as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      autoattachPodInterface: false
----

bridge
^^^^^^

In `bridge` mode, virtual machines are connected to the network backend
through a linux ``bridge''. The pod network IPv4 address is delegated to
the virtual machine via DHCPv4. The virtual machine should be configured
to use DHCP to acquire IPv4 addresses.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: red
          bridge: {} # connect through a bridge
  networks:
  - name: red
    pod: {}
----

At this time, `bridge` mode doesn’t support additional configuration
fields.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note:* due to IPv4 address delagation, in `bridge` mode the pod doesn’t
have an IP address configured, which may introduce issues with
third-party solutions that may rely on it. For example, Istio may not
work in this mode.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

slirp
^^^^^

In `slirp` mode, virtual machines are connected to the network backend
using QEMU user networking mode. In this mode, QEMU allocates internal
IP addresses to virtual machines and hides them behind NAT.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: red
          slirp: {} # connect using SLIRP mode
  networks:
  - name: red
    pod: {}
----

At this time, `slirp` mode doesn’t support additional configuration
fields.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note:* in `slirp` mode, the only supported protocols are TCP and UDP.
ICMP is _not_ supported.
