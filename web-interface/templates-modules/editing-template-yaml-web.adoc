== Editing the YAML of a Virtual Machine Template

You can edit the YAML configuration of a virtual machine template directly within the web console.

Not all parameters can be updated. If you edit values that cannot be changed and click *Save*, an error message shows, indicating the parameter that was not able to be updated.

NOTE: Navigating away from the YAML screen while editing cancels any changes to the configuration you have made.
