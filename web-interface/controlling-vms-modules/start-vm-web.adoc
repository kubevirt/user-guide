== Starting a Virtual Machine

Virtual machines can be xref:vm-actions-web[started] from the &#8942; button found on each virtual machine in the *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines* list, or from the xref:vm-actions-web[*Actions*] button on the *Virtual Machine Details* screen.

.Procedure

. Click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machine* from the side menu.
. Click the &#8942; button of the virtual machine and select *Start Virtual Machine*.
.. Alternatively, click the virtual machine name to open the *Virtual Machine Details* screen and click *Actions* and select *Start Virtual Machine*.
. In the confirmation pop-up window, click *Start* to start the virtual machine.

NOTE: When a virtual machine provisioned from a `URL` source is started for the first time, the virtual machine will be in the *Importing* state while {product-title} imports the container from the URL endpoint. This may take several minutes depending on the size of the image.
