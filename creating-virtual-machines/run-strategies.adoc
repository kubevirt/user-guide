Run Strategies
---------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

VirtualMachines have a `Running` setting that determines whether or not there
should be a guest running or not. Because KubeVirt will always immediately
restart a VirtualMachineInstance for VirtualMachines with `spec.running: true`,
a simple boolean is not always enough to fully describe desired behavior. For
instance, there are cases when a user would like the ability to shut down a
guest from inside the virtual machine. With `spec.running: true`, KubeVirt
would immediately restart the VirtualMachineInstance.

RunStrategy
^^^^^^^^^^^

To allow for greater variation of user states, the `RunStrategy` field has been
introduced. This is mutually exclusive with `Running` as they have somewhat
overlapping conditions. There are currently four RunStrategies defined:

* Always: A VirtualMachineInstance will always be present. If the
    VirtualMachineInstance crashed, a new one will be spawned. This is the same
    behavior as `spec.running: true`.
* RerunOnFailure: A VirtualMachineInstance will be respawned if the previous
    instance failed in an error state. It will not be re-created if the guest
    stopped successfully (e.g. shut down from inside guest).
* Manual: The presence of a VirtualMachineInstance or lack thereof is
    controlled exclusively by the start/stop/restart VirtualMachint subresource
    endpoints.
* Halted: No VirtualMachineInstance will be present. If a guest is already
    running, it will be stopped. This is the same behavior as
    `spec.running: false`.

_Note_: RunStrategy and Running are mutually exclusive, because they can be
contradictory. The API server will reject VirtualMachine resources that define
both.

Virtctl
~~~~~~~

The `start`, `stop` and `restart` methods of virtctl will invoke their
respective subresources of VirtualMachines. This can have an effect on the
runStrategy of the VirtualMachine as below:

[cols="h,^m,^m,^m",options="header",width="50%"]
|=================================================
|RunStrategy    |start     |stop   |restart
|Always         |-         |Halted |Always
|RerunOnFailure |-         |Halted |RerunOnFailure
|Manual         |Manual    |Manual |Manual
|Halted         |Always    |-      |-
|=================================================

Table entries marked with `-` don't make sense, so won't have an effect on
RunStrategy.
