Interfaces and Networks
-----------------------

Connecting a virtual machine to a network consists of two parts. First,
networks are specified in `spec.networks`. Then, interfaces backed by
the networks are added to the VM by specifying them in
`spec.domain.devices.interfaces`.

Each interface must have a corresponding network with the same name.

An `interface` defines a virtual network interface of a virtual machine
(also called a frontend). A `network` specifies the backend of an
`interface` and declares which logical or physical device it is
connected to (also called as backend).

There are multiple ways of configuring an `interface` as well as a
`network`.

All possible configuration options are available in the
https://kubevirt.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_interface[Interface
API Reference] and
https://kubevirt.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_network[Network
API Reference].

Backend
~~~~~~~

Network backends are configured in `spec.networks`. A network must have
a unique name. Additional fields declare which logical or physical
device the network relates to.

Each network should declare its type by defining one of the following
fields:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=================================================
|Type |Description
|`pod` |Default Kubernetes network
|`multus` |Secondary network provided using Multus
|`genie` |Secondary network provided using Genie
|=================================================

pod
^^^

A `pod` network represents the default pod `eth0` interface configured
by cluster network solution that is present in each pod.

multus
^^^^^^

It is also possible to connect VMIs to secondary networks using
https://github.com/intel/multus-cni[Multus]. This assumes that multus is
installed across your cluster and a corresponding
`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD was created.

The following example defines a network which uses the
https://github.com/kubevirt/ovs-cni[ovs-cni plugin], which will connect
the VMI to Open vSwitch’s bridge `br1` and VLAN 100. Other CNI plugins
such as ptp, bridge, macvlan or Flannel might be used as well. For their
installation and usage refer to the respective project documentation.

First the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` needs to be created. That is
usually done by an administrator. Users can then reference the
definition.

[source,yaml]

      "type": "ovs",
      "bridge": "br1",
      "vlan": 100
    }'
----

With following definition, the VMI will be connected to the default pod
network and to the secondary Open vSwitch network.

          bootOrder: 1   # attempt to boot from an external tftp server
        - name: ovs-net

  - name: default
    pod: {} # Stock pod network
  - name: ovs-net
    multus: # Secondary multus network
      networkName: ovs-vlan-100
----

It is also possible to define a multus network as the default pod network with
https://github.com/intel/multus-cni[Multus]. A version of multus after this
https://github.com/intel/multus-cni/pull/174[Pull Request] is required
(currently master).


*Note the following:*

* A multus default network and a pod network type are mutually exclusive.
* The virt-launcher pod that starts the VMI will *not* have the pod network
configured.
* The multus delegate chosen as default *must* return at least one IP address.


Create a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` with IPAM.

              "subnet": "10.250.250.0/24"
      }
    }'

Define a VMI with a https://github.com/intel/multus-cni[Multus] network as the default.

      interfaces:

          bridge: {}
  networks:
  - name: test1
    multus: # Multus network as default
      default: true
      networkName: macvlan-test
----

genie
^^^^^

It is also possible to connect VMIs to multiple networks using
https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/CNI-Genie[Genie]. This assumes that genie
is installed across your cluster.

The following example defines a network which uses
https://github.com/coreos/flannel-cni[Flannel] as the main network
provider and as the https://github.com/kubevirt/ovs-cni[ovs-cni plugin]
as the secondary one. The OVS CNI will connect the VMI to Open vSwitch’s
bridge `br1` and VLAN 100.

Other CNI plugins such as ptp, bridge, macvlan might be used as well.
For their installation and usage refer to the respective project
documentation.

Genie does not use the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD. Instead it
uses the name of the underlying CNI in order to find the required
configuration. It does that by looking into the configuration files
under `/etc/cni/net.d/` and finding the file that has that network name
as the CNI type. Therefore, for the case described above, the following
configuration file should exist, for example,
`/etc/cni/net.d/99-ovs-cni.conf` file would be:

[source,json]
----
{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "type": "ovs",
  "bridge": "br1",
  "vlan": 100
}
----

Similarly to Multus, Genie’s configuration file must be the first one in
the `/etc/cni/net.d/` directory. This also means that Genie cannot be
used together with Multus on the same cluster.

With following definition, the VMI will be connected to the default pod
network and to the secondary Open vSwitch network.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:

          bridge: {}
  networks:
  - name: default
    genie: # Stock pod network
      networkName: flannel
  - name: ovs-net
    genie: # Secondary genie network
      networkName: ovs
----

Frontend
~~~~~~~~

Network interfaces are configured in `spec.domain.devices.interfaces`.
They describe properties of virtual interfaces as ``seen'' inside guest
instances. The same network backend may be connected to a virtual
machine in multiple different ways, each with their own connectivity
guarantees and characteristics.

Each interface should declare its type by defining on of the following
fields:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====================================================
|Type |Description
|`bridge` |Connect using a linux bridge
|`slirp` |Connect using QEMU user networking mode
|`sriov` |Pass through a SR-IOV PCI device via `vfio`
|`masquerade` | Connect using Iptables rules to nat the traffic
|====================================================

Each interface may also have additional configuration fields that modify
properties ``seen'' inside guest instances, as listed below:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Format |Default value |Description
|`model` |One of: `e1000`, `e1000e`, `ne2k_pci`, `pcnet`, `rtl8139`,
`virtio` |`virtio` |NIC type

|macAddress |`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` or `FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF` | |MAC address
as seen inside the guest system, for example: `de:ad:00:00:be:af`

|ports | |empty |List of ports to be forwarded to the virtual machine.

|pciAddress |`0000:81:00.1` | |Set network interface PCI address, for
example: `0000:81:00.1`
|=======================================================================

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: default
          model: e1000 # expose e1000 NIC to the guest
          masquerade: {} # connect through a masquerade
          ports:
           - name: http
             port: 80
  networks:
  - name: default
    pod: {}
----

[NOTE]
====
* If a specific MAC address is configured for a virtual machine
interface, it's passed to the underlying CNI plugin that is expected to
configure the backend to allow for this particular MAC address. Not every
plugin has native support for custom MAC addresses.

*  For some CNI plugins without native support for custom MAC
addresses, there is a workaround, which is to use the `tuning` CNI plugin to
adjust pod interface MAC address. This can be used as follows:
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: ptp-mac
spec:
  config: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "ptp-mac",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "type": "ptp",
          "ipam": {
            "type": "host-local",
            "subnet": "10.1.1.0/24"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "tuning"
        }
      ]
    }'
----


This approach may not work for all plugins. For example, OKD SDN is not
compatible with `tuning` plugin.

* Plugins that handle custom MAC addresses natively: `ovs`.
* Plugins that are compatible with `tuning` plugin: `flannel`, `ptp`, `bridge`.
* Plugins that don't need special MAC address treatment: `sriov` (in `vfio`
  mode).

Ports
^^^^^

Declare ports listen by the virtual machine

NOTE: When using the slirp interface only the configured ports will be
forwarded to the virtual machine.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|============================================
|Name |Format |Required |Description
|`name` | |no |Name
|`port` |1 - 65535 |yes |Port to expose
|`protocol` |TCP,UDP |no |Connection protocol
|============================================

TIP: Use `e1000` model if your guest image doesn’t ship with virtio
drivers.

NOTE:  Windows machines need the latest virtio network driver to configure
the correct MTU on the interface.

If `spec.domain.devices.interfaces` is omitted, the virtual machine is
connected using the default pod network interface of `bridge` type. If
you’d like to have a virtual machine instance without any network
connectivity, you can use the `autoattachPodInterface` field as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      autoattachPodInterface: false
----

bridge
^^^^^^

In `bridge` mode, virtual machines are connected to the network backend
through a linux ``bridge''. The pod network IPv4 address is delegated to
the virtual machine via DHCPv4. The virtual machine should be configured
to use DHCP to acquire IPv4 addresses.

NOTE: If a specific MAC address is not configured in the virtual machine
interface spec the MAC address from the relevant pod interface is delegated to
the virtual machine.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: red
          bridge: {} # connect through a bridge
  networks:
  - name: red
    multus:
      networkName: red
----

At this time, `bridge` mode doesn’t support additional configuration
fields.

[NOTE]
====
* Due to IPv4 address delegation, in `bridge` mode the pod doesn’t have
an IP address configured, which may introduce issues with third-party solutions
that may rely on it. For example, Istio may not work in this mode.

* Admins can forbid using `bridge` interface type for pod networks via a
designated configuration flag. 
To achieve it, admins should set the following option to `false`:
+
[source,yaml]
-----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-config
  namespace: kubevirt
  labels:
    kubevirt.io: ""
data:
  permitBridgeInterfaceOnPodNetwork: "false"
-----
* Binding the pod network using `bridge` interface type may cause issues.
Other than the third-party issue mentioned in the above note, 
live migration is not allowed with a pod network binding of `bridge` interface type,
and also some CNI plugins might not allow to use a custom MAC address for your VM instances.
If you think you may be affected by any of issues mentioned above, 
consider changing the default interface type to `masquerade`, 
and disabling the `bridge` type for pod network, as shown in the example above.
====

slirp
^^^^^

In `slirp` mode, virtual machines are connected to the network backend
using QEMU user networking mode. In this mode, QEMU allocates internal
IP addresses to virtual machines and hides them behind NAT.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: red
          slirp: {} # connect using SLIRP mode
  networks:
  - name: red
    pod: {}
----

At this time, `slirp` mode doesn’t support additional configuration
fields.

NOTE: In `slirp` mode, the only supported protocols are TCP and UDP. ICMP is
_not_ supported.

More information about SLIRP mode can be found in
https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#User_Networking_.28SLIRP.29[QEMU
Wiki].

masquerade
^^^^^^^^^^

In `masquerade` mode, KubeVirt allocates internal
IP addresses to virtual machines and hides them behind NAT.
All the traffic exiting virtual machines is "NAT'ed" using pod IP addresses.
A virtual machine should be configured to use DHCP to acquire IPv4 addresses.

To allow traffic into virtual machines, the template `ports` section of the
interface should be configured as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: red
          masquerade: {} # connect using masquerade mode
          ports:
            - port: 80 # allow incoming traffic on port 80 to get into the virtual machine
  networks:
  - name: red
    pod: {}
----

[NOTE]
====
* Masquerade is only allowed to connect to the pod network.

* The network CIDR can be configured in the pod network section using the
`vmNetworkCIDR` attribute.
====

virtio-net multiqueue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting the `networkInterfaceMultiqueue` to `true` will enable the
multi-queue functionality, increasing the number of vhost queue, for
interfaces configured with a `virtio` model.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      networkInterfaceMultiqueue: true
----

Users of a Virtual Machine with multiple vCPUs may benefit of increased
network throughput and performance.

Currently, the number of queues is being determined by the number of
vCPUs of a VM. This is because multi-queue support optimizes RX
interrupt affinity and TX queue selection in order to make a specific
queue private to a specific vCPU.

Without enabling the feature, network performance does not scale as the
number of vCPUs increases. Guests cannot transmit or retrieve packets in
parallel, as virtio-net has only one TX and RX queue.

NOTE: Although the virtio-net multiqueue feature provides a
performance benefit, it has some limitations and therefore should not be
unconditionally enabled

Some known limitations
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Guest OS is limited to ~200 MSI vectors. Each NIC queue requires a MSI
vector, as well as any virtio device or assigned PCI device. Defining an
instance with multiple virtio NICs and vCPUs might lead to a possibility
of hitting the guest MSI limit.
* virtio-net multiqueue works well for incoming traffic, but can
occasionally cause a performance degradation, for outgoing traffic.
Specifically, this may occur when sending packets under 1,500 bytes over
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) stream.
* Enabling virtio-net multiqueue increases the total network throughput,
but in parallel it also increases the CPU consumption.
* Enabling virtio-net multiqueue in the host QEMU config, does not
enable the functionality in the guest OS. The guest OS administrator
needs to manually turn it on for each guest NIC that requires this
feature, using ethtool.
* MSI vectors would still be consumed (wasted), if multiqueue was
enabled in the host, but has not been enabled in the guest OS by the
administrator.
* In case the number of vNICs in a guest instance is proportional to the
number of vCPUs, enabling the multiqueue feature is less important.
* Each virtio-net queue consumes 64 KB of kernel memory for the vhost
driver.

NOTE: Virtio-net multiqueue should be enabled in the guest OS
manually, using ethtool. For example:
`ethtool -L <NIC> combined #num_of_queues`

More information please refer to
http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Multiqueue[KVM/QEMU MultiQueue].

sriov
^^^^^

In `sriov` mode, virtual machines are directly exposed to an SR-IOV PCI device,
usually allocated by https://github.com/intel/sriov-network-device-plugin[Intel
SR-IOV device plugin]. The device is passed through into the guest operating
system as a host device, using the
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vfio.txt[vfio] userspace interface, to
maintain high networking performance.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VM
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: sriov-net
          sriov: {}
  networks:

    multus:
      networkName: sriov-net-crd
----

To simplify procedure, please use
https://github.com/openshift/sriov-network-operator[OpenShift SR-IOV operator]
to deploy and configure SR-IOV components in your cluster. On how to use the
operator, please refer to
https://github.com/openshift/sriov-network-operator/blob/master/doc/quickstart.md[their
respective documentation].

NOTE: KubeVirt relies on VFIO userspace driver to pass PCI devices into VMI
guest. Because of that, when configuring SR-IOV operator policies, make sure
you define a pool of VF resources that uses `driver: vfio`.
